        <p class="anim">Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries vokalia and consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>

It’s an event where any tech-enthusiast, regardless of their individual field can come & participate to learn, build & share their creations over the course of a weekend, in a relaxed & productive environment. Hackathons are simply a venue for self-expression & creativity, where people come together & transform their thoughts into reality, through technology. </p>

        <h2 class="anim">About Hack Club</h2>
        <p class="anim">Hack club is a global network of programming clubs where members learn to code through tinkering and building projects. Computers give us superpowers. Hands on experiences are so important. Real-world experience with code is so important! Learning to code is your way into this world. Crossing this bridge unlocks the power to make stories, drawings, or wires into websites, games, robots, and things nobody but you imagine. It’s not about learning a programming framework—it’s about learning to teach yourself. Best of all, you can join a worldwide community of people doing the same. This hacker culture brings out the best in us all.</p>
